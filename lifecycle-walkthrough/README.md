# Responsible AI Workshop - End-to-End Responsible AI Lifecycle Walkthrough

This module contains an end-to-end walkthrough of a Responsible AI lifecycle.

It is illustrated by following the complete ML workflow on a loan decision use case using [Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) and its MLOps capabilities, the integration with [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)
Azure DevOps, etc. in the context of AI systems embedded in cloud-native applications, and that provides to this purpose an end-to-end illustration spanning a concrete use case: Implementing a responsible AI lifecycle for MLOps processes. 

This walkthrough is meant to accompany the eponym illustration guide [Implementing a responsible AI lifecycle for MLOps processes](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-workshop/blob/main/lifecycle-walkthrough/docs/guide_implementing_responsible_ai_lifecycle.docx), which tackles exactly this use case and can be found under the docs folder.


## Data

For the sake of the walkthrough, we use the [UCI adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). 

The data folder includes the datasheet documenting the motivation behind the dataset, it's composition, collection procedure and recommended uses.
